# USB computer keyboard simulator
This project makes it possible to use a computer, especially its keyboard, as an output device for another computer.

## Hardware
The hardware looks like this. There are two ports, appropriately labeled with the words *slave* for the computer whose keyboard you will use and *master* for the PC on which what has been typed will be written.
Inside there are an **Arduino Nano** and an **Arduino ProMicro** that take care of the communication between the *master* and the *slave*.

## Software
The code that allows this device to work is shown below and inside the *master* and *slave* folders.
